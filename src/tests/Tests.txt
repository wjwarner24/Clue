explanations of some test cases in FileInitTests.java

testing the door directions:
    (2,7) has a door pointing left which is tested
    (4,17) has a door pointing right which is tested
    (7,4) has a door pointing up which is tested
    (16,3) has a door pointing down which is tested

testing for number of doors
    just by sheer chance, my game board has 17 doors, the exact number in the FileInitTests306.java.
    I placed my doors pretty randomly and did not count them, but alas this method is an exact copy of the provided one.

testing rooms
    I selected random cells from some rooms to test


hopefully this is enough info for this file, have a good day!
