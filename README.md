The goal is to find the solution to the game before the other computerPlayers, 
just like the real clue game!

Sometimes after clicking on elements, the panels go blank. Simply resize the window and it will fix itself.

At the start of the game, you automatically draw cards to your hand representing a room, a player, and a weapon.
The same is true for the other computerPlayers, and the cards that comprise the solution to the game are not drawn into anybody's hand.

Each turn you automatically roll a dice, then choose where to move your player on the board.
If you ended up in a room, you will make an guess by selecting a player and a weapon.
The guess will be disproven by one of the other players showing one of the cards in your accusation was in their hand.

If the guess is not disproven, on the following turn, you may make an accusation for that player, room, and weapon.
If your accusation is correct, you win the game!

Good luck, because the computerPlayers are also trying to win the game.
